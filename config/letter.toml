  "After so many moons with you, I still can't find the words to express to you how important you have become to me.",
  "As I made this little project for you, I went through my gallery, to get a glimpse of the relationship we built together. And it dawned on me the extent of your impact in my life.",
  "I noticed myself taking more pictures of the world around me, since I wanted to show it to you. I noticed myself taking more pictures of myself, as I wanted you to see me at my hottest. The way I started a business, resolved myself to build a proper future for us, started new hobbies.",
  "My world truly expanded with you around.",
  "I have always said it, and will say it any time. I didn't know it was possible to love the way I love you.",
  "I truly hope that soon we'll light up the night sky at a lantern festival. I dream of the day I get to wake up in a nice hotel with you. For the days when we get to sit down and yap face to face the way we do on the phone now.",
  "I hope you know, that from the bottom of my heart, I'm grateful.",
  "Thank you for saying yes... both now, and on the 1st of August",

  "With all my heart, I love you.",
